Tangled in Tulle was founded in 2012 by a Bonneville high school senior. You can read more about our story here. Since then, we've opened a shop and expanded into wedding dresses. We love helping girls feel beautiful!

Emily started the business as a senior project, and has continued to be involved since. She's responsible for all things web-related and still loves searching for new gowns.

Once Emily graduated, Esther took over the business. She is the dress consultant, main alteration magician, and fairy godmother to all.
